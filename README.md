# DCT2PC
A systematic calibration transfer &amp; quantification method for NIR spectroscopy. DCT2PC extracts key principal components via SVD, and ensemble ELM builds robust regression models for cross-instrument quantitative analysis. Validated on corn/tobacco/pharmaceutical datasets, outperforming TEAM with lower RMSEP.
